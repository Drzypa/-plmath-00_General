The {\em integral sign}
                               $$\int$$
is a stylised version of the {\em long s} letter.

The long s is a typographic variant of lowercase s, being the only lowercase s in the Carolingian minuscule script.\, The 
modern short (round) s appeared later to the ends of words, and has now replaced completely the long s in the antiqua script.

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz introduced the integral sign as the first letter s of the Latin word {\em summa} (`sum').\, The long shape of $\displaystyle\int$ may be thought to symbolically depict the fact that \PMlinkname{integral}{DefiniteIntegral} is a limiting case of sum.\\

A variant 
$$\oint$$
of the integral sign is used in integrals taken along a closed curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or about a closed surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$; see e.g. Cauchy integral theorem, derivation of heat equation.\\

The function given after the integral sign, i.e. the function to be {\em integrated}, is the {\em integrand}.
