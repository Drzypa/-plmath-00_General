For the purpose of this feature, the arbitrary cutoff is $10^7$.

{\bf 19099919} is the smallest prime to start a Cunningham chain of length 8.

{\bf 85864769} is the smallest prime to start a Cunningham chain of length 9.

{\bf 545587687} is the smallest class 13+ prime in the Erdos-Selfridge classification of primes.

{\bf 635318657} is the smallest number that can be expressed as a sum of two fourth powers in two different ways.

{\bf 823766851} is the smallest prime with primitive root 48.

{\bf 906150257} is the smallest counterexample to P\'olya's conjecture.

{\bf 1023456789} is the smallest pandigital number in base 10.

{\bf 1704961513} is the smallest class 14+ prime in the Erd\H{o}s-Selfridge classification of primes.

{\bf 10123457689} is the smallest pandigital prime in base 10.

{\bf 26089808579} is the smallest prime to start a Cunningham chain of length 10.  

{\bf 665043081119} is the smallest prime to start a Cunningham chain of length 11.

{\bf 554688278429} is the smallest prime to start a Cunningham chain of length 12.

$10^{13} + 1$ is, as of 2005, the smallest candidate for a counterexample to the Mertens conjecture (though the smallest counterexample could turn out to be as large as $3.21 \times 10^{64}$).

{\bf 4090932431513069} is the smallest prime to start a Cunningham chain of length 13.

{\bf 95405042230542329} is the smallest prime to start a Cunningham chain of length 14.

{\bf 810433818265726529159} is the smallest prime known to start a Cunningham chain of length 16, but there could be a smaller such prime.

{\bf 439351292910452432574786963588089477522344721} is the smallest prime in Paul Hoffman's erroneous version of Wilf's primefree sequence in which $a_1 = 3794765361567513$, $a_2 = 20615674205555510$ and $a_n = a_{n - 2} + a_{n - 1}$ for $n > 2$.

If an odd perfect number exists, it is at least $10^{300} + 1$.
