The {\em Mac OS Calculator} is a software calculator that comes bundled with the Apple Mac OS operating system. As late as Mac OS 9, the Calculator was a very basic calculator with only the arithmetic operations. In Mac OS X, the Calculator program was upgraded, with not just the addition of Scientific mode (a scientific calculator) but also Programmer mode with functions useful for computer programmers, such as Unicode character lookup by numerical value. The currently displayed value is not lost at a change of mode.

Like the Windows Calculator, for the Mac OS Calculator $0^0 = 1$.
