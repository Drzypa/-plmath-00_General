\begin{document}
This mock-up of a basic calculator is realistic in that it has almost every function one can expect on a typical basic calculator. The layout will of course be different on an actual calculator. A calculator shaped like, say, a credit card will have more columns of buttons than rows.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
MC & & OFF & C & ON \\
MR &  &  &  & $\div$ \\
M+ & 7 & 8 & 9 & $\times$ \\
STO & 4 & 5 & 6 & $-$ \\
$\sqrt{x}$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & + \\
\% & 0 & . & $\pm$ & = \\
\end{tabular}

A basic calculator can be counted on to have buttons for the basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division). A button for square root is sometimes provided, its operation usually being ``postfix''. The percentage key, when provided, does not always behave in a standard way. For example, on some calculators, a 15\% tip on a meal costing $\$42.54$ might be computed as $[4] [2] [.] [5] [4] [+] [1] [5] [\%] [=]$.
