This will be a guide to textbook projects on PM.  Since I don't know
if there currently are any textbook projects on PM, this is just a
``stub'' entry for now.  If you create a textbook project, please add
a link to it here.  Let me know what other things you would like to
see as part of this entry.  (Eventually we will probably create a
documentation item for textbook writing.)  I think the 00-01 category
can and should contain articles \emph{about} instructional exposition,
just as well as examples of instructional exposition, so perhaps such
discussions can begin here as well, and then branch off into other
entries as that becomes convenient.

An example of the sort of textbook we might want to have would
be: a free book comparable to \emph{Introduction to Algorithms} by 
Cormen \emph{et al.}.
