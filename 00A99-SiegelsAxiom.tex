\begin{document}
In a mathematical text two mathematical symbols that do not form a larger \PMlinkescapetext{complex} of \PMlinkescapetext{symbols} have to be \PMlinkescapetext{separated} by at least one word or by a punctuation mark.\\
\textbf{Example:} Do not write ``... take $n$ $n\times n$-matrices'', but rather ``take $n$ matrices of order $n\times n$''.
